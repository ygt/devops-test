# Palatinate Group DevOps Test

Thank you for taking the time to do our technical test. The aim is get
an example of your DevOps work in a simplified context. We'd imagine
you'd spend around an hour on it - though a bit more or less isn't a
problem.

Please don't PR this repo - instead make a local copy with your
changes and send us the completed repo as a tar/zip archive or a link
to your repo.


## Technical Task

Here is a basic hello-world Python app. We'd like you to deploy it to
the cloud as you would any production service, explaining the
decisions you make along the way.

One way to run it locally is:
```
pip install flask
FLASK_APP=app.py python -m flask run
```
The requirements are:

* Deploy to a cloud provider (any is fine)

* Code allows us to create your solution environment on our own

* Production-ready


## Technical Questions

1. How long did you spend on the technical task? What more could you
do if you spent longer?

2. Describe the choices you made? Would you do anything differently if
you were doing it again?

3. What did you like most/least about this exercise?
